## Module

A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Gropuing related code into a module
makes the code easier to understand and use.

	A module is a Python object with arbitrary named attributes that you can bind and reference.
	Simply, a module is a file consisting of python code. A module can define function, classes 
	and variables. A module can also include running code.
